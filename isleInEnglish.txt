Knits latest Islandora modules and libraries

TODO: How many Drupal modules are overwritten by Islandora modules, and what are the reasons against/consequences of just installing those Islandora modules without their Drupal defaults? (put another way: is overwrite = TRUE in [1] just a precautionary contingency plan, or part of Drupal>Islandora best practice?)
