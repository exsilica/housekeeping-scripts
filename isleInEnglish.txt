SECTION 1: Site Building

ISLE/apache/isle_drupal_build_tools
Contents:
2 drush makefiles: drupal and islandora
Script to adjust permissions
Install script combining these build tools


install_isle_ld_site.sh
--
[1]
In a temporary directory:
Builds Drupal site using drupal makefile (see: drupal.drush.make)
Installs Islandora modules using islandora makefile (see: islandora.drush.make)
Moves contents of tmp to proper (Drupal site) locations

[2]
1.10 release dependency upgrade
(OSD)

[3]
Initialize Drupal site

[4]
Variable setting (used in this case as prefix assignment)

[5]
Enable Drupal, then Islandora modules
*** If `drush openseadragon-plugin` is here WHY THE FIX ***

[6]
# Commented out
Cron job

[7]
Ensure necessary permissions by running permissions script
--

drupal.drush.make
--
Knits latest Drupal modules and libraries
*** Note: jwplayer (slated for Islandora deprecation) is here. Will this be removed when 1.11 is released? ***
---

islandora.drush.make
---
[1]
Initialize defaults: modules downloaded via git from 7.x to /modules/islandora, to overwrite any existing modules

[2]
Knits latest Islandora modules and libraries

TODO: How many Drupal modules are overwritten by Islandora modules, and what are the reasons against/consequences of just installing those Islandora modules without their Drupal defaults? (put another way: is overwrite = TRUE in [1] just a precautionary contingency plan, or part of Drupal>Islandora best practice?)

SECTION 2: Container Knitting

ISLE
Contents:
5 containers: apache, fedora, mysql, proxy, solr
Installer: ansible (Without knowing ansible, apparently contains info ansible wants)
Customization directory: config
Vagrantfile for setup: vagrant
-- Without deeper assesment, appears to be data necessary for those following vagrant system setup steps in documentation
Script to knit containers, local/test configurations
-build script, for developers only, TODO: assess difference and purpose

docker-compose.yml
---
[1]
Initialize "services"
-- Docker image, container name, environment, networks, ports, volumes
-- mysql, fedora, solr, apache, proxy

[2]
As needed, define internal and external networks and data volumes

APPENDIX: Misc. Questions

ISLE/apache
The settings.php that lives here is not the settings.php that is generated in the drupal makefile (see: drupal.drush.make). Does this overwrite default settings.php? If so, what is its relationship to the settings.php in ISLE/config/isle-prod-project.institution/apache, which should be the location for customized files that will overwrite defaults?

ISLE/vagrant
This seems to be for a specific installtion use case. Does it belong here, in core ISLE? In the spirit of "use tools as needed and get rid of them" Gavin was extolling at H/D, can this be moved?
