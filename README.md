Accessory and utility scripts for file management and Islandora

## Players
* Archives & Special Collections: Process & provide source material
* Music Library: Special special collections coming soon to a digital library near you
* Digital Projects: Digitize SpecCol material and provide files in Archival processing format
* Digital Scholarship & Technology Services: Input digitized SpecCol material into Digital Library

The majority of these scripts exist to help materials between the three departments play nice with one another without the need to compromise the integrity of one department's schema and processing formats.

All material local to [Vassar College Libraries](https://library.vassar.edu) with an eye to scalability over time.
